programs 1-5


1) Insertion Sort Algorithm

step 1:-insert elements in the array
step 2:-using for loop iterate over the array and compare the previous key with the current key
step 3:-if greater move up and create space to swap elements


2) Linear Search Program Algorithm

step 1:-insert elements in the array
step 2:-enter the search element
step 3:-using for loop match the search element with elements in the array
step 4:-return the postion at which element found else return match not found


3) Selection Sort Algorithm

step 1:-insert elements in the array
step 2:-first search through the enter array and swap minimum to the first position
step 3:-now the first element is sorted again traverse through the unsorted array and place the minimum to the first position of unsorted array
step 4:- do the following using loops until the array is sorted


4) Bubble Sort Algorithm

step 1:-insert elements in the array 
step 2:-traverse through the array from the left and compare adjacent elements
step 3:-the element higher is placed to the right
step 4:-the highest element is placed right most and so on do this till the array is sorted


5) Function to return gcd of a and b
 
1.if(a==0)
  return b;
  return gcd(b % a, a);
2. end of if loop
3.Initialize a and b
4. Function call
    printf("GCD(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, gcd(a, b));
    a = 35, b = 10;
